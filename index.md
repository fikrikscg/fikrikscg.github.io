My current research addresses political economy questions about power grid management. Through building capacity expansions models, I attempt to reveal the optimal pathways of renewable energy deployments at western U.S. states, under political uncertainties. These uncertanties include the establishment of regional market in the western U.S., future of RPS and CES targests, and different timelines of proposed transmission projects.
